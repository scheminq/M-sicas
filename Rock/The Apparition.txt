Why are you never real?
Whenever you appear, you leave me with that grace
I am trembling with fear, but I know that you will disappear
Just as I awake, whisper in my ear

Well I believe somewhere in the past
Something was between you and I, my dear
And it remains with me to this day
No matter what I do
This scar will never fade

So let's make trouble in the dream world
Hijack heaven with another memory now
I make the most of the turning tide
It just split what's left of the burning silence
Don't wait, cause this could be the last time
You turn up in the reveries of my mind
I wake up to a suicide frenzy
Loaded dreams still leave me empty

I believe somewhere in the past
Something was between you and I, my dear
And it remains with me to this day
No matter what I do
This wound will never heal

Why are you never real?
The shifting states you follow me through unrevealed
Just let me go, or take me with you

(So let's make trouble in the dream world)
(Hijack heaven with another memory now)
(I make the most of the turning tide)
(It just split what's left of the burning silence)
(Don't wait, cause this could be the last time)
(You turn up in the reveries of my mind)
(I wake up to a suicide frenzy)
(Loaded dreams still leave me empty)
